# Magento Product Grid Export

This package adds the same export button functionality as is available on other grids 
like the order grid, to the product grid.
It is compatible with multiple view, pagination, search, and filters.
It will be an exact replica of the grid you see.
Exporting a single page, a couple products or ALL products are all possible.

## Installation

Require this package:

```shell
composer require justbetter/magento2-product-grid-export
```

## Usage

After installation the export button will be shown next to the "Columns" dropdown on the product grid.
Simply select the products you want to export and the format you want to export (Currently only CSV is supported).
